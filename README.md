1. Question 1
    1. Just by running the code (in google colab), we can see the output of the code in wandb.
2. Question 2
    1. Here we created a class called Neural_network with parameters x_train,y_train,input_dimension,hidden_layers_size,hidden_layers,output_dim,batch_size,epochs,activation_func,learning_rate, decay_rate,beta,beta1,beta2,optimizer,weight_init
    2. Here when we create an object to this class then we need to pass the training data (x_train,y_train), input dimension size, hidden layer size, number of hidden layers, output dimension, batch size, number of epochs, which activation function we want to use, learning rate, decay rate, beta, beat1, beta2 for adam optimizer, which optimizer we want to use and which which weight initializer we want to use.
    3. In this python file we implemented gradient descent optimizer; activation functions of Sigmoid, tanh and Relu; and random and xavier weight initializers.
